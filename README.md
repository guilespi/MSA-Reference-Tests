# multiple_seq_aligner

Script for running multiple alignment sequence programs and compare against balibase reference alignments.

Just a excuse to play a little with `stevedore` and have this process automated.

Results are exported to a `csv` file including running time for each algorithm alignment (very rough none the less)

## Usage

You need to have:

* BAliBase original sequences fasta files
* POA, ClustalW2, T-Coffee, Dialign programs somewhere on your computer
* Time to wait

Modify the path variables accordingly.
